            <h2>My Interests in Accessibility</h2>
            <p>I believe that accessibility should not be an afterthought in development. 
                Accessibility should be a component of proper code design. Some things I am interested in are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keyboard navigation</li>
                <li>Color contrast and readability</li>
                <li>Screen reader compatibility</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="accessibility">
            <h2>My accessibility focus</h2>
            <p>Accessibility has not always been something that I thought much of. 
                However, I have been trying to get better at keyboard only navigation in an effort to use my mouse less.
                I was surprised how many sites supported keyboard navigation and how useful some of these elements are.
                For example, "Skip to Main Content" links and headers are so useful for quick navigation.
                Realizing that these exist due to accessibility made me realize how much accessibility makes everyone's lives easier.
